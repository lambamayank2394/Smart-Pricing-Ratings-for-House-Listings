# Smart-Pricing-Ratings-for-House-Listings-
### Motivation : 
As more and more people are joining online platforms like Airbnb and others like it in order to list their spaces, there is a tremendous opportunity/need to perform analysis on existing data from these platforms in order to predict variables like price, ratings for homeowners . We want to be able to recommend areas of improvement for incoming or existing hosts that might help them improve their ratings and eventually attract more customers. 
### Statement : 
Predict ‘price’ and ‘ratings’ of the house/room listings using the Airbnb data for New York with the help of various features present in the data (like ‘room type’, ‘neighborhood’, ‘amenities’, etc.).

### Instructions:
Run the jupyter notebook cell by cell to perform the analysis.
